# odin-recipes
A Foundations project for The Odin Project

## Background
This was not my first encounter with HTML by any means, so this was a straightforward project. I've been tinkering around with HTML since 1996.

## What I Learned
The primary things I learned were some better ways to use VSCode and to write better commit messages. This is my first time doing multi-line commit messages. If there is a way to do it directly from VSCode using its internal git tools instead of through the command line, I'd do it that way.

There was also some difficulty dealing with my linux distro's preference for flatpaks, but that was easily fixed by using the .deb file instead. I don't use Chrome as my main browser so I did not lose any settings by doing this.

## Update - CSS Additions

Added colors, a container div, more visible navigation, centering, a new font family, and better typography overall.
